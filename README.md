# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the code attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters but fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid integer. This can lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the faulty code. The route handler parses the user ID as an integer but doesn't handle the case where the ID is not a valid number.  This can cause errors if a user provides non-numeric input.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code.  It includes error handling to check if the parsed user ID is a valid integer before attempting to use it. If it's not a valid integer, an appropriate error response is returned to the client.
